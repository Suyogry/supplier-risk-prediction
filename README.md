# **Supplier Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning**

## **Overview**
This project leverages **data analytics and machine learning** to predict supplier risk in procurement. The goal is to help businesses identify high-risk suppliers based on historical performance, financial stability, and transaction behavior, enabling proactive decision-making and process optimization.

## **Problem Statement**
Organizations face significant challenges in **supplier reliability**, leading to delayed deliveries, cost overruns, and quality issues. Traditional supplier risk assessment methods are **manual, inefficient, and reactive**. This project aims to build an AI-powered solution to **predict supplier risk categories (Low, Medium, High)** using **historical transaction data and machine learning models**.

## **Solution Approach**
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   - Gathered supplier transaction data, delivery performance, financial scores, and contract compliance details.
   - Handled **missing values, outliers, and duplicates** using Pythonâ€™s `pandas` and `numpy`.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized trends in supplier performance using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
   - Identified correlations between **on-time delivery rates, defect ratios, and supplier reliability scores**.
   
3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Created **new features** like `avg_delivery_delay`, `defect_order_ratio`, and `transaction_consistency_score`.
   - Used **one-hot encoding** for categorical variables (e.g., supplier location, contract type).
   
4. **Model Selection & Training**
   - Trained multiple classification models: **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost**.
   - Optimized hyperparameters using **GridSearchCV**.
   - Selected **Random Forest** as the best-performing model with **85% accuracy**.
   
5. **Model Evaluation & Business Impact**
   - **Precision & Recall metrics** ensured fewer false positives in supplier risk classification.
   - Enabled procurement teams to **reduce high-risk supplier selection by 40%**, optimizing cost and efficiency.
   - Built a **Power BI dashboard** to provide real-time supplier risk monitoring.

## **Technologies & Tools Used**
- **Programming & ML:** Python (`pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`)
- **Data Processing & Storage:** SQL, ETL Pipelines
- **Data Visualization:** Power BI, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- **Deployment & Code Management:** Streamlit (for interactive web app), GitHub

## **Results & Business Impact**
   **Achieved 85% accuracy** in predicting supplier risk.
   **Reduced high-risk supplier selection by 40%**, improving procurement efficiency.
   **Built an interactive Power BI dashboard** for real-time supplier risk monitoring.

## **Future Enhancements**
